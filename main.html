<h1>Hi there! <br> <br>
    Happy birthday, loagie!!</h1> <br>

    <p>Before you continue, play this playlist. It's kinda funny, I wanted the playlist to be long enough so that it soundtracks this gift. In about 5 minutes, it's already 1hr 14mins. I'll leave it at around that for now, but maybe I'll add more to it once I give you this LOL.</p> <br>

    I don’t really know how to start these - you’d think that I’d have thought of a way to start this considering I’ve been thinking and writing out paragraphs in my head, but I haven’t quite been the sharpest tool in the shed LOL
    <br>
    Okay, preface, what is this?
    <br>
    I dunno, it’s a compilation of things that make me happy that’re related to you.
    <br>
    Usually, my ‘little’ updates of my life are usually based around my life and oh my god I did this and that and this happened and that happened.
    <br>
    But today’s your day, and I couldn’t think of a birthday present - namely because I’m broke and you’d be able to afford whatever bullshit it was anyway, so maybe I’ll give you something that no one else will ever think of giving you!
    <br>
    Silly? Sure, but I don’t.. particularly care. It’s just for me and you, and that’s what I love about it most.
    <br>
    I guess I’ll address what the elephant in the room is (to me).
    <br>
    I’m sorry we drifted apart, I know it’s literally neither of our fault, we both got super busy with whatnot, but I still feel bad about it, and I miss you. I hope you’re doing well. I know you hate the self-loathing shit, so that’s gonna be that for now.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hi!!! Meepyyyyy, I don’t think I’ll ever have the heart to call you my “ex” or anything similar. It’s funny how you can cause foreshadowing on your own. Who would’ve known how much truer this would’ve been?

Fear is so strange, don’t you think?  Especially a fear of height. Walking in a straight line on a sidewalk is nothing for anyone, even though there’s a pretty high chance of dying if you trip in front of a car. 

Walk on a roof of a house and suddenly your legs start shaking and you feel fear, just from the fear of the height you’re at. 
Is there really a difference in the likelihood of you falling and dying?

I find it even more interesting in my own case. A couple floors high I’ll be ever so comfortable with, even though I’m fully aware that it would take a miracle for me to survive the fall. But add a couple floors higher to it and I’m fucking mortified, my legs start shaking and my heart starts racing. 

If I were to fall from either height I would’ve died all the same, but my surroundings terrify me. 

I wonder if nearly every emotional fear is equally as irrational and artificial as a fear of heights? 

Maybe a leap of faith is what it always takes. 

Maybe it just takes that same push and fearlessness everytime to get over everything. 

I was afraid of love for the longest time, scared of getting attached. 

I guess you’re my leap of faith.
<br>
<br>
<br>

    <br>
    I think you truly taught me how to love. Things might change and time will pass, but you’ll always have a piece of my heart. They say that you never fully get over your first love.
    <br>
    Maybe that’s super corny, but honestly, it feels like I had a “first love” experience with you. I learned how to love, learned how to feel it, learned how to express it, all with you.
    <br>
    I don’t think I’ll ever get over you.
    <br>
    And maybe that’s scary. Maybe I’ve become one more hoe and bitch in who’s mind you live rent-free. But maybe you’ll also see this for a little more than the gay little love letter it is.
    <br>
    It’s also a thank you.
    <br>
    Because truly, thank you for teaching me all you did. There are very few memories that I look back to and can say “damn, I hate that” (those are all from one day, you know which one).
    <br>
    From learning about street fashion and browsing rings, watching you play Lucian and Pyke, getting annoyed with me for not understanding why Viego in custom lobbies is boring and IE second item is retarded, playing valorant with me, showing me your taste in music (Childish Gambino is in the playlist, and so I still listen to Ground Rules), showing me your taste in watches and car browsing with me, looking at Tom Ford perfumes with me, telling me my Eula has a fat ass and watching weird faggot porn with me.
    <br>
    Thank you for all the experiences. You not only became a lover, but also my sweet and dear friend.
    <br>
    Honestly, if I wasn’t intimidated by you from time to time (don’t ask why, I just wonder if I’ll fuck things up or you’re sick of me, the usual things that are irrational for me, and make no sense to you), I’d probably still bother you whenever I get on.
    <br>
    So, what now?
    <br>
    I said thank you for both the time you served (like some kind of fucking slave LMAO) as both my lover and my sweet and dear friend.
    <br>
    This isn’t supposed to bring things back to the way they were or anything, that’s not the point of this.
    <br>
    Do I wish we could talk more? Yeah. Hopefully we might, if you’re not put off by this cringey expression of borderline insanity. (I wonder if I’ve finally become the psycho super-obsessed gf you thought me to be).
    <br>
    It’s really a thank you letter. If I read this back, I can guarantee you it won’t even begin to encompass the way you changed me for the better, the way you affected me and my life.
    <br>
    This is also a bit of revenge, I want to steal a piece of your heart the way you did mine, so that no matter what happens, I’ll never just be another hoe or bitch that’s eternally down bad for you. (I won’t change my discord nickname until you will!!! And you better have a good reason for doing that, or else!!)
    <br>
    My biggest fear is that someday you’ll look back to me and your time with me and see it all as wasted time. I hope you can look back at it all and see it as cherished time with someone you loved.
    <br>
    I say this all like it’s a goodbye message or some shit, it’s not, I hope we can play league again and talk every now and then.
    <br>
    It’s funny because I’ve come to realize that a lot of the things I say when I write things come from a place of insecurity that makes me write things thinking you’ll respond to them and confirm or disprove whatever it is I’m saying. But I think you’ve known that for a lot longer than I did.
    <br>
    There’s some of my favourite clips of you attached in this webpage, getting it to fucking load like this was such a bitch. When I send you this, there’ll probably also be the source code for the webpage. You can look for the few little Easter eggs I threw in it, or don’t.
    <br>

    <br>
    I’m never gonna expect a super long response or anything, but, hey. Something would be better than nothing.
    <br>
    Until the next time we talk.
    <br>
    Thanks again. For everything.
    <br>
    I love you, both as my sweet and dear friend, the one that taught me how to love, and maybe the person that also saved my life in a way.
    <br>
    My heart’s racing as I finish this.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sorry, adrenaline
    <br>
    <br>
    Oh, actually just now I had an idea. What if I asked you to call and had you read listen and watch all this on call???
    <br>
    Not a bad idea, though if you don’t like it I might fucking die.
    <br>
    We’ll see. Okay, time to end the letter.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for everything,
    <br>
